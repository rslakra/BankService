# AI Usage Report - Banking REST Service Development

## Overview
This document details the AI-driven development approach used to create the Banking REST Service, including tools used, prompts, iterations, challenges, and areas requiring manual intervention.

## AI Tools Used

### Primary AI Assistant: Claude (Anthropic)
- **Version**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Role**: Complete application architecture, code generation, testing, and documentation
- **Usage Duration**: Entire development cycle

### Capabilities Leveraged
- Full-stack Python development expertise
- FastAPI framework knowledge
- Database modeling and SQLAlchemy ORM
- Security best practices (JWT, password hashing)
- Comprehensive test suite generation
- API documentation creation
- Error handling and validation

## Development Approach

### Initial Prompt and Requirements Analysis
**Initial Prompt:**
```
Generate code with unit-tests as the full python FastAPI application for it [referring to the banking service requirements]
```

**AI Response Strategy:**
1. Analyzed the comprehensive requirements document
2. Identified all core components needed
3. Selected appropriate technology stack
4. Planned modular architecture
5. Designed comprehensive test coverage

## Code Generation Process

### 1. Application Architecture
**AI-Generated Components:**
- `main.py` - FastAPI application with all endpoints
- `models.py` - SQLAlchemy database models
- `schemas.py` - Pydantic validation schemas
- `database.py` - Database configuration
- `test_main.py` - Comprehensive unit tests

**Reasoning Behind Architecture:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between models, schemas, and business logic
- **Security First**: JWT authentication, password hashing, input validation
- **Testability**: Modular design enabling comprehensive testing
- **Scalability**: FastAPI's async capabilities and proper database patterns

### 2. Database Design
**AI-Driven Decisions:**
```python
# Relationship modeling
class User(Base):
    accounts = relationship("Account", back_populates="owner")

class Account(Base):
    owner = relationship("User", back_populates="accounts")
    transactions = relationship("Transaction", back_populates="account")
```

**Rationale:**
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Automatic ID generation for sensitive data (account numbers, card numbers)
- Audit trail with timestamps
- Enum types for data consistency

### 3. Security Implementation
**AI-Generated Security Features:**
```python
# Password hashing
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

# JWT token creation
def create_access_token(data: dict):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```

## Example Prompts and Iterations

### Iteration 1: Core Structure
**Prompt**: "Create the main FastAPI application structure with authentication"
**Output**: Basic app structure with JWT authentication
**Refinement**: Added comprehensive error handling and validation

### Iteration 2: Database Models
**Prompt**: "Design SQLAlchemy models for banking entities"
**Output**: Complete database schema with relationships
**Refinement**: Added automatic field generation (account numbers, card numbers)

### Iteration 3: Business Logic
**Prompt**: "Implement transaction processing and money transfers"
**Output**: Transaction handling with balance updates
**Refinement**: Added insufficient funds checks and atomic operations

### Iteration 4: Testing Suite
**Prompt**: "Create comprehensive unit tests for all functionality"
**Output**: Full test coverage including integration tests
**Refinement**: Added edge cases and error scenario testing

## Challenges Faced and AI Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Relationship Modeling
**Problem**: Managing bidirectional relationships between User, Account, Transaction, Transfer, and Card entities.

**AI Solution**: 
- Implemented proper SQLAlchemy relationships with `back_populates`
- Used foreign keys with appropriate cascade behaviors
- Ensured referential integrity

**Code Example:**
```python
class Transfer(Base):
    from_account = relationship("Account", foreign_keys=[from_account_id])
    to_account = relationship("Account", foreign_keys=[to_account_id])
```

### Challenge 2: Transaction Atomicity
**Problem**: Ensuring money transfers update both account balances atomically.

**AI Solution**:
- Used database transactions with proper commit/rollback
- Implemented balance validation before processing
- Created corresponding transaction records

### Challenge 3: Security Considerations
**Problem**: Protecting sensitive financial data and operations.

**AI Solutions**:
- JWT-based authentication with expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- User isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Input validation and sanitization

### Challenge 4: Comprehensive Testing
**Problem**: Covering all business logic scenarios and edge cases.

**AI Solution**:
- Created test fixtures for reusable test data
- Implemented integration tests for complete workflows
- Added negative test cases for error scenarios
- Mock authentication for isolated testing

## Manual Interventions Required

### 1. Environment Configuration
**What Was Manual**: 
- Setting up Python virtual environment
- Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
- Database initialization on first run

**Why Manual**: Environment-specific setup that varies by deployment target

### 2. Security Configuration
**What Was Manual**:
- Generating secure SECRET_KEY for production
- Configuring CORS settings for specific domains
- Setting up HTTPS/TLS termination

**Why Manual**: Production security requires environment-specific configuration

### 3. Database Migration Strategy
**What Was Manual**:
- Database backup and migration procedures
- Production database connection strings
- Performance tuning and indexing

**Why Manual**: Production database management requires DBA expertise
